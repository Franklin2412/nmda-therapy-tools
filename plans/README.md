## 💡 Philosophy

**"Technology empowering recovery, one game at a time."**

These tools are not meant to replace professional therapy—they are designed to **complement** and **extend** clinical rehabilitation. The goal is to provide:
- **Extra practice** between therapy sessions
- **Engaging activities** that motivate children to keep working on recovery
- **Progress tracking** for parents and therapists
- **Empowerment** for families who want to actively participate in recovery

- 🌍 **Globally accessible** (via web, no app stores)
- 🆓 **Forever free** (open-source, no subscriptions)
- 🧠 **Clinically validated** (developed with medical input)
- 💖 **Made with love** (by someone who understands the journey)

---

## 🚀 Let's Begin

**Next Step:** Share these documents with the medical team and schedule a review meeting.

**Questions this review should answer:**
1. Are the proposed applications clinically appropriate?
2. What modifications would you recommend?
3. Which application should be prioritized first?
4. How can these tools integrate into existing therapy plans?
5. What safety considerations should we implement?
6. Would you be willing to provide ongoing clinical guidance?

**After medical review:** Begin development of the highest-priority application (likely Memory Garden).
