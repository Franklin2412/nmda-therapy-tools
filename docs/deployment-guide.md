## 🏥 Sharing with Hospital

Simply share the GitHub Pages URL with the medical team:
- `https://[username].github.io/nmda-therapy-tools/`

### Option 2: Embed in Hospital Website

If the hospital wants to integrate it into their website, they can use an `<iframe>`:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://[username].github.io/nmda-therapy-tools/" 
  width="100%" 
  height="800px" 
  frameborder="0"

- HandyHelper: `https://[username].github.io/nmda-therapy-tools/handy-helper/` (when ready)

### Option 3: White-Label Version

If the hospital wants their own branded version:

1. Fork the repository
2. Customize colors/branding in `shared/css/common.css`
3. Add hospital logo to landing page
4. Deploy to their own GitHub Pages or hosting

## 📊 Analytics (Optional, Privacy-Friendly)

If you want to track usage (anonymously) to understand impact:

### Option 1: Simple Counter (No personal data)
Use a free service like [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) - privacy-focused, GDPR-compliant

### Option 2: Self-Hosted
Use Plausible or Umami (open-source, privacy-friendly analytics)
